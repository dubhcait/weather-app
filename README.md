# Weather App

 This is a project using React and OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)



 ### Aims:

- [x]  Implement data tracker class that keeps track of min, max, mean, and mode values.

- [x]  Call 5-day forecast on the target city (with cnt=5 GET parameter) and create following different data tracker objects from above data tracker class

- [x]  Render these data tracker objects into a separate UI section called statistics
 

## Setup

### Installation

 1. use `git clone` the project
 2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, get in contact for Environment variables 
 3. use `yarn install` to install all dependencies in the express server
 6. use `yarn start` to launch the project on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
 7. you can use `yarn build` to create a local version of how the project will build on the live production version
 8. you can run `yarn test` to run tests locally.

 ### If I had more time

 - Error handling for the form 
 - More tests
 - Better UI
